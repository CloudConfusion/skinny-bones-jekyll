# I'm kind of a big deal


##### Diary of a Loud Mouthed Braggart from The Future

So, after a good dozen years or more in I.T. I finally picked up some Microsoft Certificates. Now I think I‘m a genius in a $3600 suit and people are incredibly interested in my showing off about all the cool stuff I can do.

More seriously:I've started doing a lot of stuff that is a bit closer to *bleeding edge* ┬than I was previously used to.

(A good edition behind at minimum has been the normal in the finance industries I‘ve frequented).

Turns out when you‘re not on a 5 year tech lag there‘s less info out there.

Now that I‘m doing SCCM CB and updating Windows 10 , Mobile , MDM as it comes out almost, Office 365 is flying in there and Azure is cutting a fine dash, I thought I‘d try to both keep track of what I did to get stuff working and try and increase the amount of info available in a nice clear style.

Or I‘m┬hustling to try and get Microsoft MVP,

not quite sure myself. Probably 40/60.
